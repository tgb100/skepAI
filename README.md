## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with modern design system
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for content analysis
- **Web Scraping**: Custom implementation with fallback options
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)

### Web Scraping Approach
The application attempts to fetch article content directly from URLs using:
1. **Primary method**: Direct fetch with CORS handling
2. **Fallback method**: Proxy service for CORS-restricted sites
3. **Alternative method**: Manual text input for blocked content

*Note: Some news sites may block automated scraping. In such cases, users can copy-paste article text directly into the application.*

### AI Prompt Engineering
The application uses carefully crafted prompts for each analysis type:
- **Claims Extraction**: Structured prompts that distinguish facts from opinions
- **Bias Detection**: Context-aware analysis of language patterns
- **Red Flag Identification**: Multi-criteria evaluation system
- **Question Generation**: Targeted verification strategies

---

## üìä Output Format

The analysis generates a comprehensive **Critical Analysis Report** in Markdown format:

```markdown
# Critical Analysis Report for: [Article Title]

### Core Claims
‚Ä¢ Claim 1: Specific factual assertion with context
‚Ä¢ Claim 2: Statistical or numerical claim
‚Ä¢ Claim 3: Policy or procedural claim

### Language & Tone Analysis
Classification and detailed explanation of the article's linguistic approach, 
identifying persuasive techniques and emotional appeals.

### Potential Red Flags
‚Ä¢ Specific bias indicators found in the text
‚Ä¢ Source credibility issues
‚Ä¢ Missing context or opposing viewpoints

### Verification Questions
1. Targeted research question for independent fact-checking
2. Source validation inquiry
3. Context verification strategy
4. Alternative perspective exploration
```

### Step 2: AI Analysis Process
The application performs multi-stage analysis:
1. **Content Extraction**: Fetches and parses article text
2. **Claims Identification**: Uses Gemini AI to extract factual assertions
3. **Language Analysis**: Evaluates tone and bias indicators  
4. **Red Flag Detection**: Identifies credibility concerns
5. **Question Generation**: Creates verification strategies

### Step 3: Review Results

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- URL validation and content extraction
- AI response parsing and error handling
- Edge cases: paywalled sites, malformed URLs, non-news content
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Known Limitations
- **CORS restrictions**: Some sites block cross-origin requests
- **Rate limiting**: Free Gemini API has usage limits
- **Language support**: Currently optimized for English content
- **Paywall content**: Limited access to subscription-only articles

## üêõ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>CORS Issues with News Sites</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Browser blocks requests to news sites
**Solution**: Application automatically falls back to proxy service
**Alternative**: Copy article text and paste directly into the tool

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini API Rate Limiting</strong></summary>

**Problem**: API requests being throttled
**Solution**: Application implements request queuing
**Prevention**: Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Poor Analysis Quality</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Generic or inaccurate analysis results
**Solution**: Check article content quality and length
**Note**: Very short articles or press releases may yield limited analysis
